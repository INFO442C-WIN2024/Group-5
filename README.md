**Husky Connect** is a website designed to connect UW students looking for study partners.
We created this app to help students find the study help they need, and to help foster a positive, academic community for students.

Our tech stack includes:<br>
HTML/CSS, JS, React for the draft<br>
NextJS, Tailwind, heroui, and Vercel for final styling and hosting<br>
Firebase for the backend<br>

**Our final MVP product can be found here:**<br>
